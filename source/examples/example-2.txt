Example 2 - Set Up 2 Machines with a Gigabit Link
=================================================

One of the most exciting parts of using the GENI platform is having access to a gigabit backbone. In this tutorial, we're going to set up two networked machines just like we did in :doc:`Example 1 <example-1>`, but we're going to do two things differently:

- Set up a gigabit link between the two machines
- Set up the machines in different parts of the country
  
  - One in Utah
  - One in Washington DC

Considerations Before Proceeding
--------------------------------

**Important:** Because GENI is a shared platform, it's your responsibility as a developer to be mindful of the resources you are requesting. The resources for gigabit networks are limited, so you are encouraged to release those resources as soon as you are finished using them. This will make them available to other developers and experimenters.

It's also highly recommended that you complete the :doc:`first GENI example<example-1>` before beginning this one. This tutorial may reference introductory concepts that were explained previously.

Tutorial
--------

The steps of this tutorial are very similar to the last tutorial, up until step number 4.

Step 1. Log In to Your Management Authority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's start by logging into your management authority if you aren't already authenticated.

.. image:: ../assets/images/geni-ma-login.png

Step 2. Open Flack In A New Tab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we'll open Flack in a new browser window or tab: http://www.protogeni.net/trac/protogeni/wiki/Flack .

**Figure 2: Flack Initialized**

Step 3. Log In With Flack
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As we had done previously, choose the correct management authority if it isn't already selected along the top of flack. Click the "download" button to have your keys loaded, and enter you password.

When prompted to select where to list resources from, leave all of the options checked and click "Continue".

Step 4. Let's Look At Our Gigabit Backbones
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's take a look at the map that is displayed when the authority list loading is complete. Do you see the pink lines running across the map? Those are **gigabit backbones** that are available to use.

In order to utilize a gigabit backbone, we'll provision a machine at both ends of it. In this example, one end will be in Utah and the other will be in Washington DC.

In the image below, the Utah aggregate is black and has the number "633" on it. Washington DC is grey and has "136" on top of it.

**Note:** Because those numbers denote the number of slivers available in those aggregates, the number fluctuates, and is likely different at the time that you are reading this.

Step 5. Create a New Slice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's create a new slice for our gigabit experiment to live in. Give your slice a different name than the one in the figure below.

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-flack-new-slice.png

Click "Ok" and wait for your slice to initialize. When it's done, you will see:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-flack-slice.png

Step 6. Find A Machine With A Gigabit Link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just as before, we're at the fun part of the experiment. Let's go hunting for a machine that's hooked up to the Gigabit backbone in Utah. Click on the Map panel in the left part of the screen:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-flack-slice-to-map.png

Click on the Utah aggregate. You'll see a box pop up with a breakdown of the different authorities in that grouping. For these tutorials, we'll stick with Utah/emulab, since they have the most resources available at the time of this writing.

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-flack-aggregate-breakdown.png

Click on the box labeled "utahemulab.cm" to see the list of resources available. You'll see:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-utah-resource-list.png

Our goal here is to find a PC hooked up to a gigabit interface, which will be labeled in the right pane as "1 Gb/s (...)". Find one, like we did in the figure below. 

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-gig-resource.png

**Note:** It's possible, but not highly likely, that all gig resources are unavailable, in which case they'll have a red "x" in front of them instead of a checkmark. In this case, you may need to find another utahemulab.cm grouping on the map which has a gigabit-linked PC available.

Now that you've found a machine with a gigabit link, drag that top-level window off to the side, and bring your slice pane back up by clicking on the name of your slice on the left side.

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-back-to-slice.png

Click into your slice, and drag that resource window over to the left so you can see your pane:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-slice-gig-prep.png

Drag the Gigabit PC we found over to the pane, like so:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-resource-in-slice.png

Step 7. Find Another Machine With A Gigabit Link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've now got a machine in Utah ready to go in our Gigabit setup. But now we need a machine on the *other* end of a network link. Back to the map!

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-flack-slice-to-map.png

It was our stated intention at the beginning of this example to get a link going from Utah to Washington DC. As mentioned before, resources on GENI are limited, and it's possible that resources aren't available in DC when you run this experiment. If that turns out to be the case, **pick another grouping of resources on the map that have a pink line running from Utah**.

So let's look at Washington DC's grouping of resources, since the pink line representing a gigabit link runs directly from Utah.

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-dc-resources.png

We can see in the figure above that we have 8 resources for our use in utahemulab.cm. Click into that, and you'll likely see something similar to the figure below.

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-dc-gigs.png

Remote computing resources are prefixed with "pg" as opposed to "pc" like we saw in Utah. pg40 in the figure above is hooked up to a gigabit link â€” just what we need! We'll take the one resource available in the window above, and drag it to our slice as before.

At this point, our Utah and DC machines should be sitting in our slice:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-slice-interm.png

Step 8. Set Up a Gigabit Network!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're now ready to hook up our network. Toward the upper left part of the slice pane, a LAN resource is available for us to drag into the slice.

**Before:**

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-lan-before.png

**After:**

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-lan-after.png

From here, drag a line **from** each machine to the lan. Your final lan should look like:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-gig-lan.png

This is all very similar to how we set up our network in example 1. However, **this time we need to explicitly set the speed of the lan to be 1 Gb/s.**

Click the blue "i", or "information" icon on the lan. The information pane for the lan will appear. We want to change the *properties* of the lan, so we'll click on the "properties" tab:

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-gig-lan-info.png

In the capacity field, enter "1000000". The unit of the capacity field is in kb/s, so we enter one million to specify 1 gb/s.

.. image:: ../assets/images/ex2-lan-props.png

Click "Apply" at the bottom of the screen. If you've made it this far, congratulations! It's time to provision your gigabit network! Click "Submit" at the bottom of the slice pane, and confirm.

**Note: This can sometimes be a process that takes up to 15 minutes, and it occasionally fails or hangs. If it does fail, you may try again until it succeeds.** If it continues to fail, it may be possible that your resource was granted to another experimenter while you were setting up your lan. You can click the "refresh" icon above the "Managers" list ont he far left side of Flack to get the latest resource lists.
