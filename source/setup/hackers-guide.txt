Tips and Tricks for Hackers
===========================

There are a few handy tricks that you can use to fully experience the apps you're building. This document contains a few tricks that may be useful.

See Your Gigabit App Through A Browser
--------------------------------------

If you have a box in Utah and another in DC, as we did in :doc:`example 2 <../examples/example-2>`, with a gigabit link in between, it may be nice to see your app through a browser.

For example, perhaps one box was intended to act as a client, and another as a web server, because you're building a next-generation webapp that relies on a high speed connection. Using you application from home doesn't take advantage of the high speed link the client box has, so you need to *see* your app through the eyes of the client, as if you were sitting in Utah.

``X``, commonly called ``X11`` is a tool that can use to gain a remote desktop capability with your provisioned client. This is possible if:

1. The system you are remoting **from** (your Mac, Thinkpad, windows box, etc) supports X11
2. The system you are remoting **to** supports X11, and has SSH installed

In terms of requirement number 1, this is easiest is your laptop or desktop has a recent version of OSX or Ubuntu installed. It's possible with a Windows computer too, with a little extra work.

Requirement #2 is easily satisfiable if the system you are remoting to has Ubuntu installed. From there, getting X11 and a Firefox browser installation is as simple as::

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install xorg openbox ubuntu-desktop firefox


And then from your terminal::

	$ ssh -X username@pcXXX.genihost.net

At that point, any windowed application you run in the terminal on the remote host will open a window on your local machine. Try something like::

	$ firefox

And you should see a window appear, showing your Firefox browser running remotely:
