GENI Quick Start
================

Getting started with GENI and building a solid understanding of its capability is as easy as:

- :doc:`Obtaining GENI credentials <get-your-geni-credentials>`
- Reading up on :doc:`Key GENI Concepts <../intro/key-geni-concepts>`
- :doc:`Working through Example 1 <../examples/example-1>`

At that point, you may feel comfortable enough to start exploring what sort of tools and resources are available to you on GENI, or perhaps dive into gigabit networking and OpenFlow.

So after you've completed the 3 points above, branch out and explore:

- :doc:`Running gigabit-speed experiments on GENI <../examples/example-2>`
- :doc:`Running OpenFlow on GENI <../examples/example-3>`
- :doc:`Finding out what features and resources are available <../recources/index>`
- :doc:`Other tools that can be used to manipulate GENI resources <../recources/index>`

And lastly, if you're a hacker who wants to build webapps of the future, be sure to check out the :doc:`list of tips and trick for hackers <hackers-guide>`, which will come in handy as your apps and experiments become for sophisticated and user-oriented.
