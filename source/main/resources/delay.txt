Delay Node
==========

A delay node is a type of resource with can simulate a data transfer bottleneck. This can be handy for running experiments that would ideally have some set speed of data transfer as opposed to whatever the network is capable of.

For instance, let's say you are running a GENI experiment on a single site, where the inter-node data transfer speeds are 1000 Mbps. If you're running an experiment that tests protocols, it might make sense to run the experiment over different qualities of
