What Can I Do With OpenFlow?
============================

OpenFlow is the leading architecture of Software Defined Networking (SDN). It allows you to alter the routing rules of a compatible switch by giving you access to the *control plane*, or the part of the switch that decides how traffic is handled.

Examples of what you might do with OpenFlow:

- Set up packet forwarding so your switch acts as a bridge
- Direct traffic using one layer 2 protocol to one network, and traffic on an experimental protocol to another network
- Completely rewrite how network traffic is directed, effectively writing your own protocols
