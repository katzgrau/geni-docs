What Can I do With GENI?
========================

The GENI platform is very open-ended, but it's intended to be an environment for:

- Exploring gigabit networks
- Implementing new routing rules in those networks
- Writing application which leverage these networks

Examples
--------

Here are a few project ideas that are possible with GENI tools and resources.

**Write an application that can utilize gigabit connections**

Gigabit internet connections are the future. So what kind of network-reliant applications could you build that aren't possible with the typical consumer internet speeds of today?

**Test how different protocols are affected by network bottlenecks**

If you wanted to compare, for instance, how TCP and UDP perform under different levels of network congestion, you could easily simulate that with GENI

**Build distributed applications**

You have considerable computing and network resources available via GENI, so you can develop and test your next-generation distributed applications over gigabit links.

**Design an alternative to the IP protocol**

Is IP holding you back? Define the rules that a router follows for forwarding packets, and experiment with what *could be* the internet's future backbone protocol.
