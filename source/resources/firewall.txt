Firewalls
=========

Setting up a firewall in your GENI topology is as simple as dragging a node onto the experiment pane. Simply filter your list of resource types using the dropdown menu on the left. Select 'firewall':

.. image:: ../assets/images/core-firewall-select.png

And drag it onto your experiment: 

.. image:: ../assets/images/core-firewall-select.png

You can network and configure the properties of a firewall just like you can with any other resource type. It's just another node in the topology:

.. image:: ../assets/images/core-firewall-types.png

In the properties window above, you can specify that the firewall is either open, closed, or basic.

- Open: All traffic may flow freely
- Closed: No traffic may flow
- Basic: SSH and HTTP/HTTPs are allowed

Using an "open" style, you will be able to access the node to define rules at a later time.
