OpenFlow Basics
===============

**Note:** This is a computer networking-focused document. It's expected that you have basic knowledge of computer network architecture as specified in the :doc:`../intro/prerequisites`.

Introduction
------------

There is sometimes a need for network engineers (or developers like you) to define the behavior of their networks in a custom manner. For example, the architect may want a network switch where they can control how packets are routed, or even define a custom protocol.

Historically, this was possible via closed, proprietary switches were are sometimes prohibitively expensive for researchers and experimenters. Yet, the need for this functionality exists in order to run wide-scale projects implementing new, experimental protocols and routing rules.

OpenFlow is an API that a growing number of switch manufacturers (`like HP and its Procurve switch <http://www.openflow.org/wp/switch-hp/>`_) are implementing, and it's the leading architecture for `Software defined Networking (SDN) <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Defined_Networking>`_. 

OpenFlow is also implemented by Open vSwitch, a software-based switch you can install on an ordinary machine.

On the GENI network, you can request access to a physical OpenFlow-enabled Procurve, or simply install Open vSwitch on a machine and configure it from there.

Before going much further, you may want to know: :doc:`What exactly can I do with OpenFlow <what-can-i-do>`?
