OpenFlow on GENI
================

There are a few different ways to start experimenting with OpenFlow on the GENI network:

1. Install Open vSwitch on a standard GENI node
2. Request access to the GENI Mesoscale Infrastructure
3. Reserve one of the HP Switches in the GENI environment and install OpenFlow

Installing Open vSwitch
-----------------------

The preferred method for experimenters looking to play with OpenFlow is option #1. Open vSwitch is a software package which you can install on an ordinary node and have it act as a switch which implements OpenFlow.

This is also the easiest option with the lowest barrier to entry. The third tutorial, :doc:`Programming Networks with OpenFlow <../examples/example-3>` will walk you through the exact steps required to make this work.

Using the GENI Mesoscale Infrastructure
---------------------------------------

TODO: Hand of interest in this to help@geni.net

Reserve an HP Switch and install OpenFlow
-----------------------------------------

TODO: Include this option? Seems *very* advanced for the average developer just looking to hack.
