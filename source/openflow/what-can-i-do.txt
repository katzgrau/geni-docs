What Can I Do With OpenFlow?
============================

OpenFlow is the leading architecture of Software Defined Networking (SDN). It allows you to alter the routing rules of a compatible switch by giving you access to the *control plane*, or the part of the switch that decides how traffic is handled.

Examples of what you might do with OpenFlow [#f1]_:

- Implement a `packet filter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_(firewall)>`_ (like a firewall)
- Implement `policy based routing <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy-based_routing>`_
- Implement `static routes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_routing>`_
