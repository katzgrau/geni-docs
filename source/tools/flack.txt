Flack
=====

Flack is a visual tool that you can use to provision and network machines on GENI. It's similar to :doc:`omni <omni>` in terms of capability, however omni is a command-line tool that provides a wider range of abilities.

Because of it's low barrier to entry, Flack is the preferred tool for getting developers up and running quickly, and the :doc:`example GENI projects <../examples/index>` use it exclusively.

This document will go over the different features of Flack that may not have been touched in the examples.
