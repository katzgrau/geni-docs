.. GENI Developer Docs

The GENI Developer Docs
=======================

These documents are intended to help software developers become familiar with GENI, a project sponsored by the National Science Foundation, to help experiment with *future networks*. The "what and why" of GENI is discussed in the next section, but overall, GENI is a platform for:

- Exploring gigabit networks
- Implementing new routing rules in those networks
- Writing applications which leverage these networks

A major benefit to GENI is that experiments can run "at scale", meaning they just aren't simulated in a lab, but can be run on machines that you provision across the world.
